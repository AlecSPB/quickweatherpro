Quick Weather Pro
===============

This is a place for me to track changes and make commits to better manage updates to my android app Quick Weather.

If you have constructive criticism, I would love to hear it. I've mostly stumbled through how to write code using StackOverflow, documentation, and a few tutorials. (And I know my code is pretty hacky - I'm trying to work on it.)
